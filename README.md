# Text to Audio Script

A python script that converts PDFs to audio.

## A Note on Scope of this Project
In itself, converting PDFs to text appropriately is a challenging proposition. 
Here, I focus on the mechanics of extracting text from PDFs without diving into 
appropriately cleaning the resulting text, with the exception of removing page 
numbers from the start of the text.
